Dear beloved citizen of the GPRSC,

We have some good news, and we have some bad news.
The good news is that there is bad news. The bad news is that you will
be sent to joycamp and subjected to a week-long destitute existence.
This is the penalty for using degenerate words, as well as using
oldspeak in place of newspeak. We hope you can correct your behavior.

Your transgressions, followed by the words you must think on:
